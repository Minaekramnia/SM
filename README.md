# Summarization project for any text file 
This repo uses GLOVE vector library to summarize texts using Cosine Similarity. 
Initially it was used for summarizing World Bank projects in a larger classification project for Independant Evaluation Group. 

Before running, there is a requirement.txt that you can run in order to tune in with the appropriate version of the libraries using in the code.
